# STAT1201 | Analysis of Scientific Data | Ethics Workshop

## What is this 'ethics' thing?

Roughly speaking, ethics is the field of enquiry concerning what we should value - both things and actions.  It is a prescriptive endeavour, one concerned with how things ought to be, rather than how things actually are.  In a word, it is _normative_.

Ethicists and moral philosophers are interested in what constitutes _the good_ and _the right_.  Some key terms indicate when we are using normative or _value_ claims: 'right' and 'wrong', 'good' and 'bad', 'should' and 'ought'.

Science by contrast, is typically thought to be the empiric study of phenomena.  It's a process and description of how things really are.  In a word, it is _descriptive_.

## Facts and Values

The purpose of this workshop is to help you identify value claims in scientific literature; which will in turn allow you to assess the ethical implications of those claims.  But why might value claims in science be problematic?

Very simply, science as a process (is supposed to) tells us what (probably) is out there in the world of actual things.  But science as it is practiced is full of claims about what we should do.  Eat vegetables, drive slower, pollute less, take this pill and call me in the morning.

But we need something more than just an _is_ (ie. diarrhea related deaths fell 59% after rotavirus vaccinations [^rotavirus]) to get to an _ought_ (ie. rotavirus vaccinations ought be mandatory).  That something requires a value claim.  David Hume put this _fact - value distinction_ best 250 years ago:

>  In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.
>
>  -- David Hume,  A Treatise of Human Nature III.I.I

Now like everything in philosophy, nothing is quite this clear cut.  Some [moral philosophers][tannsjo] think you can derive an _ought_ from an _is_.  Some [philosophers of science][feyerabend] would deny the description above is what 'science' really is.  But as a beachhead into the murky world of value in science, this dichotomy will serve us well for now.

If the fact - value distinction is still a little fuzzy, consider this.  Most scientists and health professionals would most likely find the following argument unproblematic:

- Smoking increases the likelihood of acquiring lung cancer (and a range of other diseases).
- Therefore, you ought not smoke.

Unfortunately, this argument is fallacious. It is invalid because the conclusion is not entailed by the premise.  To work, we need to add an additional premise such as:

- You ought not increase the likelihood of acquiring lung cancer (and a range of other diseases)

Science might be able to 


## Ethics in Science

There are a number of ways that values claims in science can be ethically problematic and the most obvious way concerns _harm_.  As a minimum, harm can be any pain felt by sentient creatures, but it extends much further than that.  Harm can occur either to the subjects of research (physical and mental anguish from poking and prodding, exposure to risk, long term effects etc), or be a result of the research (when the results permit subsequent harm as in weapons research).

Justifiable or not, we place greater burdens of proof when the research subjects are human.  For animal subjects, our typical concern is whether firstly the harm was minimised, and secondly the remaining harm is justified by the potential benefits of the research.  Human subjects have additional requirements such as informed consent.



Harm 

- use of live subjects
    - was harm minimised?
    - was remanning harm justified?
    - was informed consent given?
- application of research
    - was the issue contentious? 
    - could the research be used for nefarious purposes?

Method

- clearance
    - did the researchers get ethical clearance?
- design
    - was the method appropriate?
    - was the sampling appropriate?
- linkage of data to conclusions
    - were the observations consistent with the hypothesis?
    - did the observations support the conclusion?

Motivations

- funding
    - was the source of funding declared?
- conflict of interests
    - did the authors stand to gain abnormal benefits?
        
## Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children

For the rest of the workshop, we are going to critically examine a scientific paper, identify it's value claims, and highlight any areas of ethical concern.  The paper, [Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children][lancet] or [pdf][lancetpdf], is a rather infamous case of how not to do medical research.

Read the paper and firstly, identify any value claims made in the paper, before secondly, assess the ethical implications of those claims.

Harm

- child subjects
- invasive, often painful procedures
- risk from sedation and procedures (lumbar punctures, pethidine)
- how was this harm justified?
- was informed consent given?
- was the research used for nefarious purposes?

Methods

- was ethical board clearance given?
- was the experimental design appropriate?
- was the sampling appropriate?
- what limits did the sample place on inferences?
- where the conclusions appropriate to the data?

Motivations

- was funding disclosed?
- was a conflict of interest disclosed?
- did the authors stand to gain personally?

At first glance, this paper doesn't appear that bad.  Consent and ethical clearance were obtained, and the conclusions were relatively weak 'we did not prove an association' and 'evidence is inadequate to show a change in incidence' (p641).

There were however, some clear give aways.  The hypothesised mechanism of vaccine -> gastro -> autism was contradicted by the symptom onset data.  All patients were referred because of behaviour and gastro, meaning no covariance could be derived.  Claims about average onset time selectively ignored unsympathetic results (data trimming); and significant claims were included in a post script.  Importantly, funding, but no conflict of interest was declared.  

The most problematic aspects of this case occurred outside of the paper.  Despite 'not proving' any findings, Wakefield held a press conference where he claimed there was strong evidence of an association.  Data in the paper relating to onset time, sample, ethical clearance, symptoms, and virology studies was falsified.

Wakefield (and others) also had significant conflicts of interest.  He held a patent on a rival vaccine, and was being paid significant amounts by the law firm suing the vaccine manufacturer.  All patents referred in the study came from doctors associated with the law firm.

Sadly, Wakefield's study and surrounding publicity resulted in a significant drop in MMR vaccinations, along with a resultant increase in cases of MMR.  Despite the drop in vaccination rates, diagnoses of autism remained unchanged.

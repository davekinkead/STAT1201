# STAT1201 | Analysis of Scientific Data | Ethics Workshop

## What is this 'ethics' thing?

Roughly speaking, ethics is the field of enquiry concerning what we should value - both things and actions.  It is a prescriptive endeavour, one concerned with how things ought to be, rather than how things actually are.  In a word, it is _normative_.

Ethicists and moral philosophers are interested in what constitutes _the good_ and _the right_.  Some key terms indicate when we are using normative or _value_ claims: 'right' and 'wrong', 'good' and 'bad', 'should' and 'ought'.

Science by contrast, is typically thought to be the empiric study of phenomena.  It's a process and description of how things really are.  In a word, it is _descriptive_.

## Facts and Values

The purpose of this workshop is to help you identify value claims in scientific literature, which will then allow you to assess the ethical implications of those claims.  But why might value claims in science be problematic?

Very simply, science as a process (is supposed to) tells us what (probably) is out there in the world of actual things.  But science as it is practiced is full of claims about what we should do.  Eat vegetables, drive slower, pollute less, take this pill and call me in the morning.

But we need something more than just an _is_ (ie. diarrhea related deaths fell 59% after rotavirus vaccinations [^rotavirus]) to get to an _ought_ (ie. rotavirus vaccinations ought be mandatory).  That something requires a value claim.  David Hume put this _fact - value distinction_ best 250 years ago:

>  In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.
>
>  -- David Hume,  A Treatise of Human Nature III.I.I

Now like everything in philosophy, nothing is quite this clear cut.  Some [moral philosophers][tannsjo] think you can derive an _ought_ from an _is_.  Some [philosophers of science][feyerabend] would deny the description above is what 'science' really is.  But as a beachhead into the murky world of value in science, this dichotomy will serve us well for now.

## Ethics in Science

For the rest of the workshop, we are going to critically examine a scientific paper, identify it's value claims, and highlight any areas of ethical concern.  The paper, [Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children][lancet] or [pdf][lancetpdf], is a rather infamous case of how not to do medical research.
